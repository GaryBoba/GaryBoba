👋 Hi, I’m @GaryBoba (Gary Boba). I'm a 2nd year graduate student pursuing a MS in Environmental Science from The College of the Environment at Western Washington University. 

My area of study is Climate Change and its impacts on outbreak events of Choristoneura freemani, the Western Spruce Budworm. 

I am experienced in GIS, Data Analysis, and Statistical Analysis using R. I have some experience with python.

Currently I'm using this repository to document my progress with the 2023 Advent of Code.

Feel free to contact me at bobag@wwu.edu.
